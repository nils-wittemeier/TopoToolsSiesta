    "# $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Invariant\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use Z2Pack to calculate the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant of bismuthene. Exercise TI_02 is a prerequisite. Most of the discussion below follows the work of Gresh et al. [[Gresh2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075146)]. \n",

    "### Hybrid Wannier Charge Centers\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological invariants are calculated in Z2Pack [[Gresh2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075146)] using Hybrid Wannier Charge Centers (HWCC), which are defined in terms of Hybrid Wannier Functions (HWF). The difference between HWFs and Wannier Functions is that the former are localized only in one direction (for instance, $x$) and delocalized in the others. In 2D, a Hybrid Wannier Function can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "|n, l_x, k_y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\mathrm{d}k_x\\; e^{i k_x l_x a_x}|\\psi^n_{k_x,k_y}\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the band index, $l_x$ is an integer, and $a_x$ is the lattice constant along the direction in which the wavefunction is localized ($x$). The charge center of an HWF is defined as the average position of the function along $x$. The **Hybrid Wannier Charge Centers** are defined modulo the lattice constant as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bar x_n(k_y) = \\langle n, 0, k_y| \\hat{x} | n, 0, k_y\\rangle   \\quad (\\textrm{mod}\\,a_x)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "One can think of an HWCC as the charge center of a Wannier Function in a 1D system, coupled to an external parameter $k_y$. In this interpretation, the sum of all HWCCs is directly linked to the 1D hybrid electronic polarization (eq. 19 in [[Gresh2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075146)])\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",

    "It should be noted that individual HWCCs are not gauge-invariant. The sum of all HWCCs and $\\mathbf{P}^h_e(k_y)$ are gauge-invariant. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From HWCC to topological invariants\n",
    "#### Chern number\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the HWCCs are defined modulo the lattice constant $a_x$, we can assume periodic boundary conditions $\\bar x(k_y) = \\bar x(k_y) + a_x$. In this way, $\\bar x(k_y)$ can be mapped on a point on the unit circle for any given $k_y$. As $k_y$ goes from 0 to $2\\pi$ the HWCCs and electronic polarization $P^h_e$ describe trajectories on a cylinder. The winding number of the trajectory of $P^h_e$ gives the Chern number of the system (Fig. 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "A Chern number can also be uniquely associated with any set of **isolated bands** and corresponds to the number of windings of the polarization of the subset of states. The Chern number of the whole system is equal to the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Under time-reversal symmetry, the Hilbert space of occupied states can be split into two subspaces which are mapped onto each other by time-reversal. This splits all Kramer pairs into states which are assigned to different subspaces. The Chern number $C_1$, $C_2$ of the subspaces are not uniquely defined and depend on which states are assigned to which subspace. However, as a consequence of the Chern number being odd under time-reversal, the two Chern numbers are always opposite $C_1=-C_2$, i.e. the Chern number of the full system is always zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Numerical computation of winding numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the winding number, we can \"unroll\" the cylinder and count the number of times the trajectory jumps from one side to the other. For instance, if the trajectory jumps from $\\bar{x}=a_x$ to $\\bar{x}=0$ the winding number increases by one. Instead, for a jump in the opposite direction, the winding number decreases by one. Given that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is defined modulo 2, we can neglect the direction of the jump and simply count the number of times the trajectory crosses $\\bar{x}=0$. In fact, it is possible to choose any line $f(k_y)$ and count the number of intersections, as long as the line connects the two ends of the cylinder (Fig. 2).\n",
