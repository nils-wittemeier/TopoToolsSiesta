    "In this exercise, we will use Z2Pack to calculate the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant of bismuthene. Exercise TI-01 is a prerequisite. Most of the discussion below follows the work of Gresh et al. [[Gresh2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075146)]. \n",

    "Topological invariants are calculated in Z2Pack [[Gresh2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075146)] using Hybrid Wannier Charge Centres (HWCC), which are defined in terms of Hybrid Wannier Functions (HWF). The difference between HWF and Wannier Functions is that the former is localized only in one direction (for instance, $x$) and delocalized in the others. In 2D, a Hybrid Wannier Function can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "|n, R_x, k_y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\mathrm{d}k_x\\; e^{i k_x R_x}|n,k_x,k_y\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the band index, $R_x = l_x a_x$, $l_x$ is an integer, and $a_x$ is the lattice constant along the direction in which the wavefunction is localized ($x$). The charge centre of an HWF is defined as the average position of the function along $x$. The **Hybrid Wannier Charge Centres** are defined modulo the lattice constant as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bar x_n(k_y) = \\langle n, R_x, k_y| \\hat{x} | n, R_x, k_y\\rangle   \\quad (\\textrm{mod}\\,a_x)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "One can think of an HWCC as the charge centre of a Wannier function in a 1D system, coupled to an external parameter $k_y$. In this interpretation, the sum of all HWCCs is directly linked to the 1D hybrid electronic polarization (eq. 19 in [[Gresh2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075146)])\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "It should be noted that individual HWCCs are not gauge-invariant. The sum of all HWCCs and $\\mathbf{P}^h_e(k_y)$ are gauge-invariant. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From HWCC to topological invariants\n",
    "#### Chern number\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the HWCCs are defined modulo the lattice constant $a_x$, we can assume periodic boundary conditions $\\bar x(k_y) = \\bar x(k_y) + a_x$. In this way, $\\bar x(k_y)$ can be mapped on a point on the unit circle for any given $k_y$. As $k_y$ goes from 0 to $2\\pi$ the HWCCs and electronic polarization $P^h_e$ describe trajectories on a cylinder. The winding number of the trajectory of $P^h_e$ gives the Chern number of the system (Fig. 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "A Chern number can also be uniquely associated with any set of **isolated bands** and corresponds to the number of windings of the polarization of the subset of states. The Chern number of the whole system is equal to sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Time-reversal invariance and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "Under time-reversal symmetry, the Hilbert space of occupied states can be split into two subspaces which are mapped onto each other by time-reversal. This splits all Kramer pairs into states which are assigned to different subspaces. The Chern number $C_1$, $C_2$ of the subspaces are not uniquely defined and depend on which states are assigned to which subspace. However, as a consequence of the Chern number being odd under time-reversal, the two Chern numbers are always opposite $C_1=-C_2$, i.e. the Chern number of the full system is always zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the two states forming a Kramer pair have to carry opposite Chern numbers. Hence, if the states exchange subspaces, the two Chern numbers can only change by an even number and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant\n",

    "is used instead. These indices are defined in terms the $\\mathbf{Z}_2$ invariants of 2D cuts through the reciprocal cell. Each cut obtained by fixing one of the components of the $k$-vector. The $\\mathbf{Z}_2$ invariant of a plane where  is often denoted by $\\Delta(k_i=x)$. The four indices are defined as\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerically accessing winding number\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the winding number, we can \"unroll\" the cylinder and count the number of times the trajectory jumps from one site to the other. For instance, if the trajectory jumps from $\\bar{x}=a_x$ to $\\bar{x}=0$ the winding number increases by one, and decreases by one for each jump in the opposite direction. Given that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is defined modulo 2, we can neglect the direction of the jump and simply count the number of times the trajectory crosses $\\bar{x}=0$. In fact, it is possible to chose any line $f(k_y)$ and count the number of intersections, as long as the line connects the two ends of the cylinder (Fig. 2).\n",

However, unless we are dealing with a model in which the dependence on $k_x$ and $k_y$ can be expressed analytically, wavefunctions and HWCCs have to be calculated on discrete meshes. Especially the discretization in $k_y$ can be a numerical challenge. When we calculate the HWCCs for a finite set of $k_y$, we probe the trajectories on parallel lines (Fig 3). And, in order to correcty determine the winding number, we need to determine which points on neighboring lines are connected.\n",

Moreover, this approach is difficult to automatize [[Soluyanov2011](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.83.235401)].\n",
